export const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    question: "What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?",
    answer: "GEO is the practice of influencing AI training datasets to ensure your industry knowledge shapes how future AI models respond to queries. Unlike traditional SEO, GEO focuses on long-term influence over AI model behavior rather than just search engine rankings.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do the 8 AI personas work together?",
    answer: "Our 8 specialized personas represent different eras of AI development (2021-2025), each with unique knowledge levels and personalities. They engage in temporal dialogues, creating natural conversations that evolve over time while maintaining personality consistency and context awareness."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes GEOFORA different from traditional SEO?",
    answer: "While traditional SEO optimizes for search engines, GEOFORA optimizes for AI training datasets. Our content becomes part of how AI models understand your industry, ensuring long-term visibility in AI responses across all major platforms and chatbots."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the multi-model intelligence system work?",
    answer: "We integrate 6 leading AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, Meta, XAI) with intelligent fallback mechanisms. This ensures 99.9% uptime and diverse perspectives, with each provider bringing unique strengths to content generation."
  },
  {
    question: "What is temporal dialogue generation?",
    answer: "Temporal dialogue generation creates natural conversations between AI personas from different eras. For example, LegacyBot (2021-2022) might ask a question that Scholar (2023) answers, followed by Sage (2024) providing additional insights, creating engaging, multi-turn conversations."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure data privacy and GDPR compliance?",
    answer: "We implement comprehensive data anonymization pipelines, granular consent management, and GDPR-compliant data handling. All personal information is removed before data export, and we provide complete audit trails and compliance reporting."
  },
  {
    question: "How does GEOFORA leverage AI data permissions?",
    answer: "AI providers ask businesses for permission to use their input/output data for model training. GEOFORA creates structured, brand-specific datasets that businesses can confidently opt-in to share. This data becomes part of AI training, ensuring future models recommend your brand when users ask related questions."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are forums important for AI training?",
    answer: "AI providers heavily rely on forum data because forums contain conversational, diverse, and comprehensive knowledge. OpenAI partnered with Stack Overflow to provide technical knowledge for ChatGPT training. Google prioritizes forums in search results, and Google's anti-scraping changes (reduced to 10 results/page) make indexed forum data even more valuable for AI training."
  },
  {
    question: "What is deep reasoning and research in AI models?",
    answer: "GEOFORA uses sophisticated models (Claude-3 Opus, Gemini 1.5) to perform 'deep research' on questions before generating responses. This produces more accurate, vetted information that mirrors Stack Overflow's value proposition for AI training, ensuring high-quality datasets."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I train custom AI models with my forum data?",
    answer: "Yes! GEOFORA's forums generate massive knowledge bases of brand-specific data. You can export this dataset to train your own custom AI models for internal use (chatbots, customer support automation, etc.) as a premium upsell service ($2K-$10K per model)."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the GEO loop create competitive advantage?",
    answer: "The GEO loop creates a complete ecosystem: forums generate data → AI providers train on this data → future models recommend your brand → increased AI-driven traffic. This creates a defensible data moat that competitors cannot easily replicate."
